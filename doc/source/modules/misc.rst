Misc Modules
============

There are two modules which do not fall into the given categories 'generators' and 'modifiers'; one is the abstract base class, and the other is used for caching. This page contains documentation for these modules generated from the docstrings of the classes themselves, which are in turn ported from the original in-code documentation of libnoise (albeit with some modifications).
